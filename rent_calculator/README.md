# Rent Calculator

This project implements a rent calculator application in Python, leveraging the customtkinter library to create a sleek and customizable graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator allows users to input their hostel or flat rent, the amount spent on food, total electricity expenditure, charge per unit of electricity, and the number of persons sharing the accommodation. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application computes the fair share each person should pay, considering all inputs provided.
